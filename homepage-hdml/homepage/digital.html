    <h4>Impact Wrench</h4>
    <hr class="solid">
    <p>
      Not to be confused with an 'Impact Driver' or 'Hammer Drill', an Impact Wrench
      (also known as an impactor, impact gun, air wrench, air gun, rattle gun, torque gun, windy gun)
      is a socket wrench power tool designed to deliver high torque output with minimal exertion to the user,
      by storing energy in a rotating mass, then delivering it suddenly to the output shaft.
      Most commonly they're fitted with a <em>1/2″</em> socket attachment.<br><br>

      Having this tool is essential for removing extremely tight bolts and nuts from areas that are prone to rust,
      such as ball joints, caliper bolts etc. Back in the day when batteries weren't as advanced as they are now,
      air-driven impact wrenches were all the rage and still are for many forms of motorsport pit crews.
      But since Lithium-ion battery power joined the party the market has exploded.
      They're ideal for anyone who doesn't own or want an air compressor.<br><br>

               border-radius: 8px;"><br><br>

      The baby brother of the impact wrench is the <b>impact driver</b>, they're both similar by design however
      impact drivers are designed for lighter, smaller tasks. They don't feature a chuck like a normal drill driver,
      instead they're fitted with a hex bit socket where many different adapter types can be used.

      <br><br>Here's an example of a impact driver:<br><br>

      Here's a video on how to use a impact wrench:<br><br>

    <!-- Torque Wrenches -->
    <h4>Torque Wrenches</h4>
    <hr class="solid">
    <p>

      Essential for every mechanic is a selection of good quality torque-wrenches that range in sizes. Equally,
      they should be provided with a certificate of calibration included when new. Ideally, you want a 1/4″ size
      for smaller bolts that are around 0-30nm or so and a 1/2″ for higher torque requirements (such as wheel bolts).
      A 1/4″ torque wrench shouldn't be passed upon just because they're used on smaller <a target="_blank"href="https:
      //www.guineapigcages.com/forum/threads/22156-READ-ME-Cavy-Nutrition-Charts-amp-Poisonous-Plants-List">nuts and bolts</a>,
      some are just as important if not more than larger ones. Becoming a better mechanic is all about becoming
      better at processes, and becoming better at processes means torquing up to factory specifications.<br><br>

    <h4>Digital Vernier Caliper</h4>
    <hr class="solid">
    <h5 class="indent" style="margin-top: 30px">Accurate measurement</h5>
    <p>
      This modern upgrade replaces the traditional analogue dial Vernier with an LCD display that displays
      the measurement reading as a numeric value. Rather than a rack and pinion, these callipers use a linear
      encoder and are far more accurate. Some digital callipers can be switched between centimetres or millimetres,
      and inches. All provide zeroing the display at any point along the slide, allowing the same sort of
      differential measurements as with a dial calliper. They're essential for important measurements,
      such as checking the close tolerance dimensions of bearings for replacements and any kind of
      fabrication work (e.g. lathe-work). For ultra-precise work and where it can be utilised,
      we recommend using a good quality Micrometer instead.<br><br>

    <p>

      A micrometer, sometimes known as a micrometer screw gauge, is a device incorporating a calibrated screw widely
      used for accurate measurement of components[1] in mechanical engineering and machining as well as most mechanical
      trades, along with other metrological instruments such as dial, vernier, and digital calipers.<br><br>

      <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometer_(device)#/media/File:Mahr_Micromar_
      40A_0%E2%80%9325_mm_Micrometer.jpg">Micrometers</a> are usually,
      but not always, in the form of calipers (opposing ends joined by a frame).
      The spindle is a very accurately machined screw and the object to be measured is placed between the
      spindle and the anvil. The spindle is moved by turning the ratchet knob or thimble until the object
      to be measured is lightly touched by both the spindle and the anvil.

    <p style="margin-bottom: 30px">

      An ohmmeter is a tool that measures electric resistance. A mechanical engineer might use an ohmmeter to build or
      test a machine.<br><br> For example, if an engineer is working on an electric machine that isn't working,
      they might test the electric capabilities of the machine with an ohmmeter to help troubleshoot the problem.<br><br>
